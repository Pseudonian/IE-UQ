    "text": "A comparative study is presented on chemical bath-deposited ZnO films, doped with the group-13 metals Al, Ga and In. The study reveals marked differences in dopant incorporation in the films, which increases in the order: In, Al and Ga. The presence of dopant in the solution induces significant modifications in the deposition rate, which varies between 110 and 40\u00a0nm\u00a0min\u22121. All films are (002)-textured, whereas the lattice stress evolution with the dopant type and concentration suggests that Ga has the highest degree of substitutional incorporation in Zn sites. The average visible transmittance is higher than 80%, while the infrared reflectivity depends on the free carrier density in the films, which is the lowest for undoped ZnO and increases in the order: In-, Al- and Ga-doped ZnO. Optical measurements also yield an inverse correlation between carrier density and mobility. Doping enlarges the bandgap, as well as the Urbach energy that is related to the films\u2019 disorder. The lowest electrical resistivity, measured by four-point probe, is 1.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22122\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0cm and is obtained for In-doped films after being exposed to ultraviolet light. Ga-doped films are found to exhibit the highest stability of the conductivity upon ultraviolet exposure.",

Microstructure has shown good grain orientation, and low porosity while slightly lower grain sizes were obtained in samples prepared from attrition milled powders. All samples show the high density of around 96% of the theoretical value. These similar characteristics are reflected in, approximately, the same electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient values for both types of samples. However, in spite of similar power factor (PF) at low temperatures, it is slightly higher at high temperature for the attrition milled samples. On the other hand, the processing time reduction (from 38 to 2 h) when using attrition milled precursors, leads to lower mechanical properties in these samples. All these data clearly point out to the similar characteristics of both kinds of samples, with a drastic processing time decrease when using attrition milled precursors, which is of the main economic importance when considering their industrial production.",

The fabrication process has been designed to allow the integration of such infrared emitters with an array of thermopile infrared detectors, with the aim of achieving an integrated non-dispersive infrared microspectrometer. A first set of infrared emitters with a common size for the doped silicon radiating slab (1,100 \u00d7 300 \u00d7 8 \u03bcm3) has been successfully fabricated and characterized. The working temperature of the Jouleheated radiating slabs has been controlled by means of DC and pulsed electrical signals, achieving temperatures well beyond 700\u00b0C. The thermal time constant measured in pulsed operation, around 50 ms, is adequate to enable the direct electrical modulation of the emitted radiation up to a frequency of 5 Hz while maintaining the full modulation depth. The temperature distribution in the radiating elements has been analyzed using two different thermal imaging methods. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2012.",

Through detailed experiments, it has been deduced that ultraviolet (UV) light is a major factor in the degradation of dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) performance due to generation of surface defects in nanoporous TiO2 and dye structural modification with free radical formation. We describe a simple spray deposition method to coat europium doped yttrium vanadate (YVO4:Eu3+) down-shifting (DS) phosphor nanoparticles (NPs) on the front side of DSSCs in order to enhance photocurrent and mitigate UV induced degradation. The nanophosphor provides an enhancement in short-wavelength spectral response of solar cells, and long-term stability is also improved under illumination, due to down-shifting of high energy UV photons to the visible region. Our observations demonstrate that the DS nanophosphor layer can be used as an optical filter with visible light transmission and UV light absorption, through placement on the front surface of DSSCs to provide stability, as well as for improving the performance.",

In this study, we employ a multi-particle Monte Carlo approach to simulate the non-linear transport of electrons inside the semiconductor bulk. All possible scattering events of hot electrons in the medium, the main details of the band structure, as well as the heating effects, are taken into account. The results presented in this study derive from numerical simulations of the electron dynamical response to the application of a sub-Thz electric field, fluctuating for the superimposition of an external source of Gaussian correlated noise. The electronic noise features are statistically investigated by computing the correlation function of the velocity fluctuations, its spectral density and the variance, i.e. the total noise power, for different values of amplitude and frequency of the driving field. Our results show the presence of a cooperative non-linear behavior of electrons, whose dynamics is strongly affected by the field fluctuations. Moreover, the electrons self-organize among different valleys, giving rise to the reduction of the intrinsic noise. This counterintuitive effect critically depends on the relationship among the characteristic times of the external fluctuations and the temporal scales of complex phenomena involved in the electron dynamical response. In particular, the correlation time of the electric field fluctuations appears to be crucial both for the noise reduction effect and the appearance of an anomalous diffusion effect.",

They correspond to transitions within the 3H4, 3H5 and 3H6 multiplets and are associated with three types of inequivalent sites of the Pr3+ ion. There are unperturbed sites similar to those observed in Pr2CuO4. Next, there are perturbed sites, also reported previously for Pr2CuO4, whose concentration increases with cerium doping. The perturbation can be described by a local deformation identical to that observed earlier in the similar compound Nd2\u2212xCexCuO4. This deformation is also presumed to be responsible for the 580 cm\u22121 Raman active A1g local mode observed in Pr2CuO4 as well as in the other Ce-doped 214 cuprates. The third type of Pr3+ site, observed only in the Ce-doped compounds, is tentatively ascribed to local inhomogeneities provoked by trapped electrons. Also, in contrast to previous Raman and neutron studies, the pronounced 125 cm\u22121 feature is found to be the low energy Eg symmetry phonon rather than a CF excitation.",

Scattering particles of doped semiconductors can sustain localized surface plasmon polaritons, which can be diffractively coupled giving rise to surface lattice resonances. These resonances are characterized by a large extinction and narrow bandwidth, which can be tuned by controlling the charge carrier density in the semiconductor. The underlaying mechanism leading to this tuneability is explained using the coupled dipole approximation and considering GaAs as the semiconductor. The enhanced THz extinction in arrays of GaAs particles could be tuned in a wide range by optical pumping of charge carriers. \u00a9 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

A 7 (2019) 18,135\u201318142). Under these conditions, the well-known instability of this material against carbon dioxide and humidity can be minimized, potentially allowing its application even in hydrocarbon-based atmospheres. Nonetheless, electrochemical transport properties of grain boundaries of BCY are still not well understood. Hence, we compare specific grain boundary conductivity and space-charge properties of BaCe0\u00b79Y0\u00b71O3-\u03b4 (BCY10) in both wet and low humidity by means of impedance spectroscopy in the temperature range 100\u2013300 \u00b0C. In H2, specific grain boundary conductivity increases in nominally dry conditions, while the bulk remains practically humidity independent. Conversely, in O2, both bulk and specific grain boundary conductivities are higher in wet. The space-charge properties highlight that low levels of humidity, pH2O ~10\u22124 atm, are sufficient to maintain functional performance, while providing enough stability. This work offers a significant advance to the knowledge of the transport properties of this family of materials at low temperatures, with special emphasis to conditions of low humidity, for potential future applications in proton-conducting electrolyte membranes.",

The magnesium can replace the zinc ions and form a solid solution in the ZnTiO3 phase, and the intensities of the ZnTiO3 peaks decreased with increasing addition of Mg. The materials thus produced are semiconductors, with a positive temperature coefficient of resistivity. Increased addition of magnesium decreases the electrical resistivity. In addition, the sintered density and c/a ratio also rise with the increasing addition of Mg, while the open porosity decreases. Moreover, the Curie temperature (Tc) of the (Zn1\u2212xMgx)TiO3 materials can be shifted to a higher temperature by increasing the Mg2+ concentration.",

The optimum preparation conditions of NS-MAG particles were researched and determined. Then the permeation fluxes of NS-MAG/PSF membranes with different doping amount of NS-MAG particles were tested. NS-MAG/PSF membrane, SiO2/PSF membrane, and PSF membrane were prepared respectively. These membranes were characterized by testing the tensile strength and the permeation flux.

We have prepared sintered CdZnS films by the screen printing method without the presence of the typical flux material. The formation of crystalline ternary compounds is inferred from the X-ray diffraction pattern of these films. Their structural and optical properties are studied by reflection spectra in a wavelength range of 300\u2013600nm. The films have a direct band gap, which varies from 3.7eV for zinc sulfide to 2.45eV for cadmium sulfide. Films with a narrow range of composition were found to be stable in Na2SO3 solution under cathodic or anodic polarization in dark and illuminated conditions. This potential interval allowed to determine the flat band potentials from capacity measurements in the dark, which indicated strong contribution of double layer capacitance, surfaces states, and non-uniform doping concentration. Electrochemical impedance measurements where further performed, giving detailed information about the relevance of these factors and the optimum composition of coupled semiconductor films for photocatalytic purposes.",

A checkerboard pattern is obtained by a Gutzwiller renormalized mean-field theory of the t\u2013J model for doping around 1 8 . It is found that the charge modulation is always an order of magnitude smaller than the bond-order modulations. This is confirmed by an exact optimization of the wavefunction by a variational Monte Carlo scheme.

The nitrogen-doped graphitized carbon was prepared from dicyandiamide waste residue with a simple acid wash process. The effects of magnetic emulsifier amount, extraction time, solution pH, and oil/water volume ratio on the formation of magnetically responsive Pickering emulsion and the extraction efficiency of the proposed dispersive liquid\u2013liquid extraction were also investigated. Under the optimized conditions, satisfactory linearities were obtained for all aldehydes with correlation coefficients larger than 0.9984. The limits of detection and quantitation of seven aldehydes were in the range of 17.3\u201330.1\u00a0ng/L and 54.3\u2013103.4\u00a0ng/L, respectively, with intra- and interday relative standard deviations less than 8.6%. The mean recoveries at three spiked levels ranged from 70.0 to 101.4%. With the Pickering emulsion as a \u201cminimized extractor\u201d, the extraction was accomplished within 5\u00a0min. After extraction, the magnetic disperser could be recovered for reuse at least five times by an external magnetic field. The proposed method was demonstrated to be feasible, simple, and economic for the trace analysis of the aldehydes in environmental water samples.",

Arsenic is a promising p-Type dopant; however, reproducible doping with high concentration is difficult and carrier lifetime is low. We systematically studied defect structures in As-doped CdTe using high-purity single crystal wafers to investigate the mechanisms that limit p-Type doping. Two As-doped CdTe with varying acceptor density and two undoped CdTe were grown in Cd-rich and Te-rich environments. The defect structures were investigated by thermoelectric-effect spectroscopy (TEES), and first-principles calculations were used for identifying and assigning the experimentally observed defects. Measurements revealed activation of As is very low in both As-doped samples with very short lifetimes indicating strong compensation and the presence of significant carrier trapping defects. Defect studies suggest two acceptors and one donor level were introduced by As doping with activation energies at ~88 meV, ~293 meV and ~377 meV. In particular, the peak shown at ~162 K in the TEES spectra is very prominent in both As-doped samples, indicating a signature of AX-center donors. The AX-centers are believed to be responsible for most of the compensation because of their low formation energy and very prominent peak intensity in TEES spectra.",

For the investigation of particle size and the surface morphology of the prepared material the field emission scanning electron microscopy have been performed. No absorption band around 980\u00a0nm has been observed in the Ho3+ doped phosphors whereas a broad band around 980\u00a0nm in the Ho3+/Yb3+ co-doped phosphors corresponding to 2F5/2 \u2192 2F7/2 absorption transition of Yb3+ ion has been detected. Up-conversion emission band have been observed in the visible region upon excitation with a 980\u00a0nm laser diode. The thermal stability of luminescence of Ca3WO6:Ho3+/Yb3+ was also investigated and the activated energy was deduced to be 0.173\u00a0eV, which shown good thermal stability. The study provides deep insights into the understanding of bidirectional energy transfer in UC mechanism, offering the possibility for applications in color displays and anti-counterfeiting techniques.",

We observe that Cd incorporation on rutile TiO2 induces Cd p-states on the top of the valence band which is consistent with an earlier result of Zhang et al. (2008) [5]. Furthermore, by creating an oxygen vacancy, some new states are induced, which originate from the Ti 3d electrons at the middle of the band gap and spread up to the conduction band. Therefore, the band gap of the material reduces significantly, making it suitable to act as a better photocatalyst.",

    "text": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 American Chemical Society.  Molecular doping has been proven as an effective way for graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) to extend its light harvesting and improve its charge separation and transport, while little attention has been paid on its effect on the charge transfer at the interfaces between GCN and the cocatalyst. Herein, a pyrimidine-based molecule, 2,4-diaminopyrimidine (DAP), was first used to combine with urea for preparing doped GCN. It is found that the optimal doped GCN sample, CN-DAP 36 , has a narrowed band gap, reduced photoluminescent emission, and longer carrier lifetime, as compared with the undoped GCN. The hydrogen evolution rate of the doped GCN is found to be 2.80 mmol/(h\u00b7g), 6.09 times that of the undoped GCN [0.46 mmol/(h\u00b7g)] under visible light irradiation. Furthermore, according to theoretical calculations, the pyrimidine groups in DAP possess a stronger adsorption capacity for Pt particles than the tri-s-triazine of GCN does, thus leading to more Pt particles deposited near the pyrimidine rings. The extension in optical absorption, the reduction in charge recombination, and the enhancement in charge transport, along with the facilitation in the interfacial charge transfer from the doped GCN sample to Pt, contribute to the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the doped GCN.",

Both the X-rays and H+(0.71MeV),He+(4.6 and 27MeV),N+(16MeV) ion beams were used for irradiation of the crystals studied. Optical absorption spectra of KDP were measured after irradiation with various H+ ion beam doses, and accumulation of the radiation-induced defects was estimated. Considerations of the radiation effects in these crystals under irradiation with the ion beams were made taking into account the results of Monte Carlo simulations using the TRIM computer codes. Using the experimental and theoretical results the paper discusses the similarities and differences of these crystals with respect to radiation hardness and the processes of radiation energy storage.",

The emission was achieved by fabricating a thin film electroluminescent device (TFEL) that consisted of a multiple layer heterostructure formed by a top transparent electrode, emitting layer, dielectric sheet and metallic back electrode. In this TFEL device, the Sr2CeO4:Eu emitting film was grown on polished BaTiO3 dielectric substrates by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) with the ablation target made of 10mol% Eu doped Sr2CeO4 luminescent powders. PLD was also used to deposit the transparent electrode using a commercial ITO ablation target. The back electrode was screen-printed using silver epoxy paste. The system showed characteristic line emissions of Eu3+ intrashell transitions being the 5D0\u21927F2 the stronger (at 610nm). CIE chromaticity coordinates are x=0.639 and y=0.360. Electro-optical measurements showed a threshold voltage at 150V with the maximum efficiency of \u223c16\u00d710\u22123lm/W at 300V.",

This technique, in combination with angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), often provides an opportunity to observe unexpected phenomena. However, the amount of transferred charge and the corresponding change in the electronic structure vary significantly depending on the material. Here, we report study on the correlation between the sample work function and alkali metal induced electronic structure change for three iron-based superconductors: FeSe, Ba(Fe0.94Co0.06)2As2 and NaFeAs which share a similar Fermi surface topology. Electronic structure change upon monolayer of alkali metal dosing and the sample work function were measured by ARPES. Our results show that the degree of electronic structure change is proportional to the difference between the work function of the sample and Mulliken's absolute electronegativity of the dosed alkali metal. This finding provides a possible way to estimate the AMD induced electronic structure change.",

The activation energy for dipolar reorientation W was found to be 0.53 \u00b1 0.05 eV over the entire lanthanide series. Least-mean-square analysis of the average values of relaxation time \u03c40 at 1 T = O(K\u22121), showed a variation from 6 \u00d7 10\u221217 sec for Ce-doped samples to 4 \u00d7 10\u221218 for those containing Yb, the estimated error of any one measurement being 10\u00b11.5 sec. The magnitudes of the observed values of W and \u03c40 are supported by an analysis of the energetically most probable dipole reorientation mechanism, interstitialcy migration. The vibrational frequencies to be expected for interstitial ions and the entropy of activation are also discussed in terms of the experimentally observed kinetic parameters.",

Herein, we report a nitrogen and sulfur co-doped hierarchical porous carbon (NSHPC) with very superior capacitance performance fabricated by KOH activation of nitrogen and sulfur co-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (NSOMC). A high electrochemical double-layer (EDL) capacitance of 351\u00a0F\u00a0g\u22121 was observed for the reported NSHPC electrodes, and the capacitance remains at 288\u00a0F\u00a0g\u22121 even under a large current density of 20\u00a0A\u00a0g\u22121. Besides the high specific capacitance and outstanding rate capability, symmetrical supercapacitor cell based on the NSHPC electrodes also exhibits an excellent cycling performance with 95.61% capacitance retention after 5000 times charge/discharge cycles. The large surface area caused by KOH activation (2056\u00a0m2\u00a0g\u22121) and high utilized surface area owing to the ideal micro/mesopores ratio (2.88), large micropores diameter (1.38\u00a0nm) and short opened micropores structure as well as the enhanced surface wettability induced by N and S heteroatoms doping and improved conductivity induced by KOH activation was found to be responsible for the very superior capacitance performance.",

The active region of this detector is defined by the pn-interface region of a highly doped GaAs homojunction. The cleavage plane normal to the interface defines a line detector with high spatial resolution. The actual resolution was tested using a near-field scanning optical microscope. An Al-coated tapered optical fiber of nominal aperture of 60 nm was scanned in the optical near-field vicinity across the active region of the junction. The photocurrent was measured as a function of the position of the fiber tip relative to the cleaved GaAs pn-junction. The width of the observed peak in photocurrent is found to be highly asymmetric with respect to the p or n side of the junction. The reason for this asymmetry is discussed in terms of diffusion length of minority carriers in the n- and p-GaAs close to the suface. \u00a9 1995 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",
